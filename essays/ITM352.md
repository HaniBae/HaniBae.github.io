While attending my home university, Seoul National University, I had the opportunity to take the required course 'Digital Computer Concept and Practice,' where I gained a broad understanding of Python. Additionally, through the 'Statistics Lab.' course, I learned how to work with R. However, apart from these two courses, unless I pursued computer science major courses, there were limited opportunities to delve deeper into coding within the curriculum of the Business Administration department. 

Yet, UHM offers a variety of ITM courses, providing me with a chance to acquire a more in-depth coding knowledge as a business administration student. Therefore, I enrolled in the ITM 352 course.
