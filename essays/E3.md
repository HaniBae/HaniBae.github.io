To summarize, WOD 5.1 was about making my previously complicated HTML code simpler. 

Following the instructions step by step, I found all the necessary information within the instructions, making it easy to complete WOD 5.1. The part that took time was manually finding and replacing <h2>, <p>, and <img> tags one by one. While the instructions recommended using regEx for this process, I wasn't familiar with regEx, so I opted for manual deletion and replacement, which took longer. 

One notable difference from previous WODs was the use of a JavaScript file. Loading and using JavaScript file in the HTML file was kinda like what we did with CSS files before in previous WODs, so it wasn't too hard. 

To better prepare and improve for the next WOD, I think I should review and practice regEx.
