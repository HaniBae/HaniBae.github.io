I actively utilized the HTML tutorial, CSS tutorial, and ChatGPT in the process of completing WOD 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 assignments. While it took me slightly over 30 minutes to complete BrowserHistory1, I significantly reduced the time for BrowserHistory2 (11 minutes) and BrowserHistory3 (23 minutes) as I familiarized myself with basic code by referring to the HTML and CSS tutorials. I believe that taking a bit more time to independently tackle these tasks without watching Dr. Port's screencasts and relying on my understanding of the tutorials, along with asking ChatGPT relevant questions, is crucial. By doing so, I felt a much stronger grasp of HTML and CSS. 

I realized that it's more important to brainstorm my solutions using tools like tutorials and ChatGPT rather than simply copying answers from Dr. Port's answer keys. The more you struggle, the stronger you become!
